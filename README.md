# DataReport-Harveys_Furniture
First-year Assignment in USYD, unit code DATA1001.
This data report gives a recommendation to the furniture store Harvey's in UK based on the data set given to me. I used skills such as data filtering and data cleaning to fully analyse the data and see trends around the data set. This is written in R studio and includes the use of R studio to create graphs and tests for data. This report also uses the HATPC process to analyse the data.
